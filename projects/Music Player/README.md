## Projects

### My Favorite Games – Search Feature

A simple webpage that displays a list of favorite games with a clean layout.  
Initially created as a CSS practice project, it was later enhanced with a JavaScript-powered search bar, allowing users to filter games dynamically.

**Core JavaScript Concepts Applied:**

- **DOM Selection (`getElementById`, `querySelectorAll`)**  
  Accesses the search input and game list elements for dynamic filtering.

- **Event Handling (`addEventListener`)**  
  Updates the displayed games in real time as the user types in the search bar.

- **String Methods (`toLowerCase`, `includes`)**  
  Ensures case-insensitive search by comparing lowercase text.

- **Loops (`forEach`)**  
  Iterates through game items to hide or show them based on search input.

### Music Player – Interactive Web Application

A custom music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation and create an interactive UI.  
The player includes essential controls, real-time track information, and a functional progress bar.

**Core JavaScript Concepts Applied:**

- **DOM Manipulation (`querySelector`, `getElementById`)**  
  Dynamically updates track details, album art, and playback controls.

- **Audio API (`Audio` object)**  
  Controls playback using methods like `play`, `pause`, and `currentTime`.

- **Event Handling (`addEventListener`)**  
  Handles button clicks for play, pause, next, and previous track actions.

- **Functions and State Management**  
  Uses reusable functions to load tracks and manage the current track index.

- **Time Formatting and Progress Bar**  
  Implements a real-time progress bar with seek functionality and formatted time display (`MM:SS`).

### **Learning Outcomes**

- Practiced **DOM access** and **real-time UI updates** with JavaScript.  
- Learned to handle **events** for user interactivity.  
- Worked with **HTML5 Audio API** to build a functional music player.  
- Improved understanding of **loops**, **conditionals**, and **state management** in JavaScript.
