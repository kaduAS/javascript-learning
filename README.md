# JavaScript Learning

This repository is my dedicated playground for mastering fundamental JavaScript concepts essential for back-end development.

## Overview

Here, I practice and deepen my knowledge of core JavaScript topics — including variables, arrays, conditionals, functions, loops, objects, and DOM manipulation — through hands-on exercises and small projects.

## Learning Journey

- Consistently refining my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and best practices.
- Applying concepts through practical coding exercises and mini-projects.
- Emphasizing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Preparing for advanced back-end topics like asynchronous programming, APIs, and database integration.
- Committing to ongoing growth and skill development.

## Future Topics

I plan to add more topics and projects as I continue learning and expanding my skills.

## Next Steps

- Expand this repository with more practical back-end projects.
- Explore Node.js and server-side development.
- Build scalable, efficient back-end services.
